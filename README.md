# EditorArray
An array class for the UnityEditor.EditorWindow class

Couldn't find a way to have arrays in a custom EditorWindow, so I created my own. Includes many features similar to the actual way arrays are displayed in the inspector, such as a + and - button, ability to change the length with an int field, and the ability to change the type to any class. Make sure to add this script to the "Editor" folder in your project.
